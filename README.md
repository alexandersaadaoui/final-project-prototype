## Project Overview

- The project is supposed to be an invitation of nostalgia, down to the classic styling and the prompt: to submit a link to an image of a toy from your childhood. After you submit a few, you can click "Show a Random Toy", and it will take you to a page with one of the toys you submitted. Once you go back, you will have to resubmit the links.

## Future Enhancements
